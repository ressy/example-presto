# pRESTO Example

This follows along with the [pRESTO example] for antibody sequencing analysis
for non-UMI Illumina data, using 25,0000 2x250 nt reads of their data from
[ERR346600].  In their workflow the reverse read starts in the V region and
heads toward J, and vice versa for the forward read.
